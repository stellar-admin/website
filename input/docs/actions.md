## Introduction

StellarAdmin allows for a standard set of actions to be performed on a resource, such as editing and deleting a resource. However, you may want to allow the user to perform other non-standard actions on a resource, for example marking an order as delivered, or publishing a blog post.

StellarAdmin allows you to define custom actions for a resource that will be displayed to the user in the Admin UI.

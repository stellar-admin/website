## Introductions

StellarAdmin allows a number of standard actions to be performed on a resource, such as editing and deleting a resource. Often, you want to allow the user to perform other non-standard actions on a resource, for example marking an order as delivered, or publishing a blog post.

StellarAdmin allows you to define actions that are attached to a resource model and displayed to the user in the admin user interface.

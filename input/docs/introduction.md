## Introduction

StellarAdmin is a library for ASP.NET Core that allows you to rapidly create admin screens for your application. StellarAdmin allows you to map your application's existing domain models or entities to "resources", which StellarAdmin uses to create admin screens for your users.

## Intended use

StellarAdmin is intended to be used to create admin screens and dashboards for your application that is used by internal admin users and support staff. It is intended to help you rapidly create screens that allow these users to manage the administrative functions of the application. StellarAdmin is **not intended for use** to create a front-end to be used by the end-users of your application.

title: Should you use StellarAdmin?
---

StellarAdmin was created to allow developers to rapidly develop internal applications for use by Administrative and Support users. It is not intended to be used for developing customer facing applications - even though there is nothing technically, or legally, preventing you from doing this.

StellarAdmin was designed for developing fairly simple CRUD applications where you want to display a list of records to a user and allow them to create, modify, or delete records. In our experience, this is typically the pattern used by most internal admin or support applications.

Customer facing applications, on the other hand, often have a much more rich user interface and may allow for many interactions and data display options beyond what your typical internal CRUD application requires.

Our general rule of thumb is as follows:

* ✅ StellarAdmin works great for fairly straightforward CRUD applications.
* ❓ StellarAdmin may also be a great fit to get an MVP or V1 of your product shipped.
* ❌ StellarAdmin will probably not work well for the more complex screens or user interactions found in many customer facing applications.

We recommend that you review the capabilities of StellarAdmin for your use case. If you find that it suits your needs then, by all means, go ahead and develop your customer facing application using StellarAdmin.

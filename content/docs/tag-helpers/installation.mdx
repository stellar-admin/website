## Introduction

StellarAdmin is a UI component library for ASP.NET Core thats allow you to rapidly create user interfaces for Razor Pages and MVC applications using [Tag Helpers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro). It is inspired by and based on the popular [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for React. It uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for client-side interactivity.

  Although StellarAdmin is inspired by and based on **shadcn/ui**, it does not
  follow some of its core principles. For more information, refer to the
  [principles](principles) document.

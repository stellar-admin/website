title: as-child
description: Merges a container element's output attributes onto a child element
---

The `as-child` Tag Helper allows the attributes and behavior of its container element to be applied to the first child element. When the `as-child` attribute is used, the container element itself is not rendered to the output. Instead, the `as-child` Tag Helper merges all the container's output attributes onto the child element, effectively substituting the container with its child in the final HTML.

This is useful where you want to wrap a child element in StellarAdmin Tag Helper to apply specific behavior, but doing so may break your HTML layout or cause other unwanted HTML output.

Let's take the following example of the Collapsible Tag Helper.

```razor
<sa-collapsible>
    <sa-collapsible-trigger>
        Expand
    </sa-collapsible-trigger>
    <sa-collapsible-content>
        This is the content
    </sa-collapsible-content>
</sa-collapsible>
```

This example produces the following HTML output, which works as expected. Take note of the `button` element generated by the `sa-collapsible-trigger` Tag Helper.

```html
<div
  x-data="collapsible(false)"
  x-bind="root"
  data-slot="collapsible"
  data-state="open"
>
  <button x-bind="trigger">Expand</button>
  <div x-bind="content">This is the content</div>
</div>
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `x-*` attributes in the generated HTML above are used by Alpine.js to
  control the collapsible behaviour.
</Callout>

Now, let's say that instead of text, we want to display a button with an icon in the trigger.

```razor
<sa-collapsible>
    <sa-collapsible-trigger>
        <sa-button variant="Ghost" size="Icon">
            <sa-icon name="chevrons-up-down" />
        </sa-button>
    </sa-collapsible-trigger>
    <sa-collapsible-content>
        This is the content
    </sa-collapsible-content>
</sa-collapsible>
```

This time the generated HTML breaks down completely and fails to work correctly. The reason for this is that we are trying to render a button inside another button and since this is not allowed, the ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers will try and fix this incorrect HTML, generating two sibling `button` elements.

The first `button` contains the `x-bind` attribute which governs the Alpine.js behavior and is generated by the `sa-collapsible-trigger` Tag Helper. The second button is our button with the icon.

```html
<div
  x-data="collapsible(false)"
  x-bind="root"
  data-slot="collapsible"
  data-state="open"
>
  <button x-bind="trigger"></button>
  <button data-slot="button" class="...">
    <svg ...>...</svg>
  </button>
  <div x-bind="content">This is the content</div>
</div>
```

What we really want is to generate only the button with the icon, but have the `x-bind` attribute applied to it.

This is where the `as-child` Tag Helper comes in. As you can see in the example below, we have the same Razor code as the previous example, but we applied the `as-child` Tag Helper to `sa-collapsible-trigger`.

```razor
<sa-collapsible>
    <sa-collapsible-trigger as-child>
        <sa-button variant="Ghost" size="Icon">
            <sa-icon name="chevrons-up-down" />
        </sa-button>
    </sa-collapsible-trigger>
    <sa-collapsible-content>
        This is the content
    </sa-collapsible-content>
</sa-collapsible>
```

This time, a single `button` element was generated and the behavior from the `sa-collapsible-trigger` (i.e. the `x-bind` attribute) was applied to the button with the icon.

```html
<div
  x-data="collapsible(false)"
  x-bind="root"
  data-slot="collapsible"
  data-state="open"
>
  <button data-slot="button" class="..." x-bind="trigger">
    <svg ...>...</svg>
  </button>
  <div x-bind="content">This is the content</div>
</div>
```

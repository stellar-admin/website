### Relationship to shadcn/ui

Before we go into some of the principles of StellarUI, we need to discuss the relationship between StellarUI and shadcn/ui and how StellarUI differs from some of the core shadcn/ui principles.

Although StellarUI is inspired by and based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), it does not follow some of its core principles. For example, shadcn/ui is not a traditional library that you reference, but rather it copies the source code for all components into your project, allowing you to "own" and extend the components as you please.

shadcn is really more of a component distribution system that allows you to install the source code for components from various sources (called registries) into your own application.

StellarUI is just a traditional component library that you reference via a NuGet package. However, it is based on the shadcn/ui styling which has two main advantages:

1. It provided a starting point for beautiful CSS styling for the various components. This saved me a lot of time during the development as I could, for the most part, simply copy the styles from the shadcn/ui components and did not have to wrestle with creating the styles myself.
2. Since it is based on the shadcn/ui styles, you can tap into the shadcn/ui theming system and override any of the [variables](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming#list-of-variables) to create your custom themes. You can also use theme variables from websites such as [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/).
